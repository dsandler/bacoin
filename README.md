Bacoin
======

Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of “bitcoin” with “bacon”, and vice
versa.

[Direct download of crx file](https://github.com/dsandler/bacoin/blob/master/Bacoin.crx?raw=true)

This is inspired by, and nearly identical to, Steve Frank's classic
[cloud-to-butt extension](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt). 

Installation
------------

Choose _Window &rarr; Extensions_ (or navigate to chrome://extensions/) and drag Bacoin.crx into the browser window.
